# Pizza-Project

## Introduction

In this project, I worked with data provided by a pizza company, which I cleaned using Google Sheets, analyzed using MS SQL, and created an interactive dashboard using Power BI. The primary objectives were to understand customer preferences, revenue trends, and product performance. This project represents my end-to-end data analytics skills, from data preparation to visualization.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Cleaning:** I cleaned and prepared the data using Google Sheets to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
- **Data Analysis:** I performed SQL data analysis to extract valuable insights.
- **Revenue Analysis:** I analyzed the company's revenue streams, identifying top-performing products.
- **Operational Efficiency:** I examined operational data to identify areas for improvement.
- **Data Visualization:** I created clear and informative visualizations to present insights.
- **Dashboard:** I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to provide an easy-to-navigate overview of the data.

## Data Sources

- Raw data provided by the pizza company.

## Data Analysis

For detailed analysis and SQL queries, please refer to the SQL scripts provided in this repository. These scripts walk through the data analysis process step by step.

## Data Visualization

I created visualizations to represent the insights gained from the data analysis. The visualizations are available in the `Pizza visualizations` folder.

## Dashboard

I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the data. The Power BI dashboard files are available in this repo.
